This application allows you to upload a document and then ask a chatbot about it. It creates embeddings through the model
provided (you can change it if you like by entering the repo-id of the model from hugging-face) and then fetches the relevant chunks
for the query.

To run this app, simple clone the repository, install the dependencies mentioned in requirements.txt and run main.py.
